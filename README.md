# 📈 Stock Trend Analysis and Forecasting – NIFTY IND DIGITAL

This project analyzes minute-level stock data from the NIFTY IND DIGITAL index using both classical time series techniques and deep learning models to forecast future price trends.

## 📌 Key Highlights
- Worked with over 227,000 minute-level stock records (open, high, low, close, volume).
- Applied STL decomposition, ADF test, and differencing to handle non-stationary data.
- Built multiple ARIMA and SARIMA models to capture trend and seasonality.
- Developed deep learning models (RNN, GRU, LSTM) to forecast high-frequency data.
- Compared classical and neural models using RMSE and MAPE.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas, Plotly, Seaborn
- Statsmodels, Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras (LSTM, GRU, RNN)

## 📁 Dataset
Minute-level stock data of the NIFTY IND DIGITAL index from 2022 to 2025, containing timestamped open, high, low, close, and volume values.

## 📈 Output
Forecasting stock closing prices using traditional models and deep learning to identify which techniques better capture complex financial patterns.

## 🧠 Learnings
- Challenges in modeling high-frequency stock data.
- Strengths and limitations of ARIMA vs LSTM-based forecasting.
- Stationarity and transformation as critical steps in time series modeling.
